# 👋 Hi, I’m Jesutofunmi Adeboye

🚀 **DevOps Engineer | Terraform Certified | Cloud & Automation Enthusiast**

I’m a **results-driven DevOps Engineer** with hands-on experience designing, automating, and managing cloud-native infrastructure. I specialize in **Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD automation, containerized applications, and Kubernetes deployments**.  

My focus is simple:  
👉 **Reduce manual work, ship faster, and build reliable systems that scale.**

I turn complex infrastructure challenges into clean, automated workflows and contribute effectively to production DevOps environments.
